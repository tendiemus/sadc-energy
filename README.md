Hi, I’m Tendeso!  
An Economics graduate with hands-on experience as a **Data Research Analyst intern** at tech-driven firms in **telecoms, energy, and venture capital**. As an entry-level **Data Specialist**, I’ve developed the technical ability to transform raw data into actionable insights — from spotting patterns in market trends to optimizing deal pipelines.  


I enjoy applying **SQL**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Google Sheets** to solve real-world problems. My specialty? Using **data storytelling** and **statistical analysis** to uncover patterns that inform sustainable development and public health strategies in Southern Africa.

## 🔋 SADC Energy Access & Future Expansion – Data Analysis Project


### 📌 Overview
This project investigates energy usage and accessibility across Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. It explores which regions lag in energy access and where future expansion could have the most impact.


### 🎯 Objective
- Assess regional support for sustainability.
- Identify countries not partaking in solar adoption.
- Link climate trends (temperature rise) to the adoption of solar energy.


### 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL Compiler
- Google Sheets
- Excel
- Power BI
- Perplexity AI


### 🗂️ Data Sources
- [World Bank Energy Data](https://data.worldbank.org)
- [IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics](https://www.irena.org)
- [SADC Energy Reports (2020–2023)](https://www.sadc.int)


### 📊 Key Insights
- **48% of rural SADC residents lack regular electricity access.**
- **Zambia and Malawi** show high solar potential but low adoption.
- **Targeted investment** in solar could reduce energy poverty by 30% by 2035.
- **Hydropower Risk**: Mozambique relies on hydro for ~80% of electricity; drought vulnerability is high.

## 🦠 SADC HIV Socioeconomic Impact Analysis


### 📌 Overview
This project explores the negative effects of HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa by analyzing links between HIV rates, death rates, birth rates, and household demographics from 2015–2025.


### 🎯 Objective
- Investigate the relationship between HIV prevalence and socioeconomic stressors.
- Rank countries by infection rates and growth trends.
- Inform effective public health responses.


### 📊 Key Insights
- **Eswatini, Lesotho, and South Africa** lead in HIV rates.
- **Polygamous households (2+ partners, 2+ children)** show up to 20% HIV risk.
- **Unemployment and education gaps** are highly correlated with HIV prevalence.
- High birth-death overlaps suggest worsening maternal outcomes in affected countries.
