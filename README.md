About
Hi, I'm Tendeso! I have a bachelor degree in Economics and some experience as a resercher and data analyst intern at tech-innovative firms specialising in telecommunications, energy and VC. 

During my time , as an entry-level data specialist l focused on developing my technical and analytical skills. My passion in discovering data insights grew as it became easier to identify patterns and trends in the markets. Whether working alone or in a team l have gained experience in data management, deal sourcing, and statistical analysis which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist to solve complex problems.

Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

SADC ENERGY
Code: Analyzing the expansion and adoption of Renewable Energy in SADC
Goal: 
- Assess regional support to sustainability.
- Identify market gaps (e.g., countries not partaking in solar adoption).
- Link climate trends (temperature rise) to use of solar power.

Description: As the world becomes more involved in the sustainable energy sector. This project explores whether the Sub-Saharan region is becoming more supportive of renewable energy, particularly solar power, and if its population is environmentally conscious as a response to increasing climate change and load shedding. The project aims to identify market gaps, forecast solar energy growth, and provide strategic recommendations for sustainable energy planning.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, filtering, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology:Postgresql, Mysql, Excel, Google sheets, Power BI, Perplexity AI

Results: SADC countries with low solar energy usage — where the majority of the population lacks access — require targeted investment to narrow the energy gap. Stabilising rising mean temperatures and adopting benchmarking practices from solar leaders (like the top 3) are critical to avoid lagging in renewable energy adoption.

SADC HIV
Code: Analyzing the widespread and negative impact of HIV in SADC
Goal: 
- Investigate correlations between HIV prevalence and socioeconomic factors (birth rates, death rates).
- Prioritize interventions by ranking countries based on infection rates and growth trends.

Description: As HIV/AIDS spreads rapidly across Southern Africa. This research investigates its correlations with birth rates, death rates, and unemployment. Over a ten year period 2015-2025  infection trends are being tracked whilst countries are ranked by prevalence. The study generates data-driven insights to inform effective public health strategies for at-risk populations. 


Skills: Data Cleaning, Boolean filtering, Time Series Analysis, data visualization.

Technology:Postgresql, Mysql, Excel, Google sheets, Power BI, Perplexity AI

Results: SADC countries with the highest high HIV rates (Eswatini, Lesotho, and South Africa) require more educational campaigns addressing polygamous relationships (identified in high-risk households with 2+ partners), effective policies to reduce unemployment (correlated with higher infection rates), and emergency healthcare funding to lower mortality rates (linked to HIV-birth rate overlaps).
